# Technical support to Geographical Society of Myanmar (GSM)
As part of the post-disaster response activity by TSBM, its sister organization (GSM) attempted to conduct field observation at most affected areas. I provided technical support to identify priority zones for field observation using damage proxy map from Remote Sensing Lab at Earth Observatory Singapore (EOS-RS).
